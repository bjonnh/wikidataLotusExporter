* wikidata Lotus Exporter

This project is used to take the LOTUS (and beyond) data from Wikidata and export it in a format
that can be used by our website.

It is made in Kotlin. All you need really is a JVM, and it should gather everything by itself.

** Build

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
./gradlew build
#+END_SOURCE

** Usage

*** Gather WikiData entries related to LOTUS locally

This can take a variable amount of time depending on how loaded the WikiData servers are. On good days it is < 5 min

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
./gradlew -q run --args "mirror"
#+END_SOURCE

*** Running a query on your new local base

#+BEGIN_SOURCE
./gradlew -q run --args "query $PWD/queries/getAllCompoundsInChIKeys.sparql"
#+END_SOURCE
